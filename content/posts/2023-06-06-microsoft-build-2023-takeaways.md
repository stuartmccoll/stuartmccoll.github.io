title: My Microsoft Build 2023 takeaways
---

I'm slowly working my way through my backlog of [Microsoft Build 2023](https://build.microsoft.com/en-US)
session recordings, but wanted to take some time out to summarise my key
takeaways from this year's event.

The common thread that ran throughout the event this year was artifical
intelligence (AI), woven into sessions focused on what developers are building
and how they're building it, as well as sessions looking at the future of work
and how this will be impacted by AI.

## Copilot everywhere

One of the biggest announcements from this year's event is that Copilot is
coming to Windows 11 (available in preview in June). Windows Copilot will
enable all Windows users to become 'power' users, putting a personal
assistant capable of taking actions, configuring settings, summarising content,
connecting accross applications, and more, right at the heart of the Windows
experience.

Elsewhere, developers can now integrate applications and services with
Microsoft 365 Copilot with plugins.

I'm excited to see how Windows Copilot can improve my daily workflows.

## Windows Terminal is getting smarter

Another application, another copilot. This time, GitHub Copilot X is coming
to Windows Terminal. Users _"will be able to take advantage of natural
language AI both inline and in an experimental chat experience to recommend
commands, explain errors and take actions"_.

I can see this being a huge time-saver. Error returned by a build script? Don't
switch context to Edge in order to search for the error, simply ask Copilot
what it means and get back an explanation, as well as a resolution, all right
there in the terminal.

## A new dashboard for Windows developers

Dev Home is an open-source, centralised place to configure a development
environment (not only a local machine, but also remote environments like
Dev Box or GitHub Codespaces), monitor system performance, and manage projects.

System performance can be monitored using a customisable dashboard, which is
extensible using widgets built using the Windows widget platform. Dev Home can
be customised using extensions, one of which will be installed by default; the
Dev Home GitHub Extension. Extensions can provide widgets for use on the
Dev Home dashboard.

Reducing the time from new machine to local development environment can only be
a good thing. It'll be interesting to see whether Dev Home does gain any
traction as being the central hub for all things development on Windows
devices.

## Dev Drive delivers performance improvements

The introduction of Dev Drive promises to deliver _"performance, security and
control"_, bringing a new type of storage volume to Windows optimised
specifically for typical developer workloads.

With an up to 30% improvement on overall build times, and performance
improvements to other operations, such as cloning repositories, Dev Drive will
bring important performance gains with minimal configuration required.

## More AI training and development comes to Microsoft Learn

Additional training and documentation is being launched on Microsoft Learn,
to help people leverage the power of AI, through instructor-led training,
self-paced learning paths, cloud games, and more.

These newly-launched offerings cover a breadth of products, including Azure
OpenAI Service, Power Apps, Power Virtual Agents, and GitHub Copilot.
