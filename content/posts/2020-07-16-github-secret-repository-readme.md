People on Twitter have recently discovered a GitHub _secret_. If you create a new GitHub repository with the same name as your profile name, you can add a `README.md` to your GitHub profile [^1].

## How to create a GitHub profile `README.md`

1. [Create a new GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/new). You'll see two mandatory options when creating your repository - the '**Owner**' dropdown field and the '**Repository name**' input field. Ensure that the '**Repository name**' value is the same as the value in the '**Owner**' dropdown field. At the time of writing this feature hasn't rolled out to all users - if it's been enabled for you, you'll see a message displayed beginning 'You found a secret'.

2. Check the '**Initialise this repository with a README**' checkbox.

3. Click the '**Create repository**' button.

4. After GitHub creates your repository, you'll be dropped into a view of the default template `README.md`. Click to edit it and add your own information using markdown [^2].

5. Commit your changes.

6. Navigate to your own profile page to check it out.
