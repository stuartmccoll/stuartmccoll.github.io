title: 10 sessions to see at GitHub Universe 2023
---

[GitHub Universe](https://githubuniverse.com/) takes place on November 8th and
9th this year, live and virtual. I've put together a list of ten sessions that
I'm particularly looking forward to.

## Opening Keynote

This year's keynote will see GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke and others look at what
it means to be a software development platform in the age of AI.

## GitHub Copilot: the AI pair programmer for today and tomorrow

Folks from both GitHub and Microsoft will be talking about the shift in
software development caused by GitHub Copilot, and other developments in the
world of AI-assisted programming.

## The future state of APIS

Ankit Sobti, Chief Technology Officer at [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
will be delivering this session, discussing advancements in API automation
and more. I've created some cool things whilst tinkering with the automation
features in Postman, so I'm always interested in news coming out of the
company.

## Maximise developer productivity and cost-savings with GitHub Actions

I'm a big fan of GitHub Actions (this website is built and deployed using
a GitHub Actions workflow) and enjoy the productivity gains that it provides.
I'm interested in the potential for cost-savings via optimisation and
automation mentioned in the description of this session. Unfortunately it's
tagged as in-person only.

## Hassle-free pull requests with GitHub Copilot

Another one that's in-person only, but ðŸ¤ž for a recording. In every project I've
ever worked on, there's always been _someone_ that'll open a pull request with
50+ files changed and zero information or context provided. It'll be great to
see how GitHub Copilot can improve the pull request process, not only for those
opening pull requests, but also in working with pull requests opened by others.

## From chaos to order: using repository rules to deliver code compliance at scale

There's something of a theme here, in that all of the sessions that look the
most interesting are tagged as in-person only. I'm always interested in
improvements to code compliance and governance, so am particularly keen to see
how that can be delivered at both a branch and repository level across an
organisation.

## How to innovate faster by standardising delivery and automating governance

Similar to the session above, this is directly in my wheelhouse. This session
promises a look into improvements in change review processes and the reduction
of subjectivity in decision-making.

## GitHub productivity via VS Code for rapid-context-switchers like me

Visual Studio Code is my daily driver, and this session promises a deep dive
into GitHub and VS Code features and extensions that can enhance focus and
productivity.

## Generative AI and the future of development

It's hard not to put a session with such a title on this list. Folks from
GitHub will be showing off GitHub Copilot and offering guidance on what it
can and can't do, and where it's best utilised.

## From fiction to function: How AI agents will reshape developer workflows

Experts from GitHub Next will be talking about their research in augmenting
development work through the leverage of AI agents. I'm hoping that this is
not only a look at GitHub Copilot, but potentially whatever comes _after_
it.
