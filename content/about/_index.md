# About

Stuart McColl is a Senior Software Developer for the [National Lottery Heritage Fund](https://www.heritagefund.org.uk). He's helping to build user-centered digital services to give a rewarding, usable experience to applicants and grantees, from their first tentative look at the Fund all the way through to them being awarded funding and becoming a grantee.

Prior to joining the National Lottery Heritage Fund, he was a Senior Software Engineer at [HM Land Registry](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/land-registry).

Away from the office he has recently graduated from the [Open University](http://open.ac.uk) with an undergraduate degree in Computer Science.
