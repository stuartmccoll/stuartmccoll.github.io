## About me

I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at [Kainos](https://www.kainos.com)
where I build new products in the [Workday](https://www.workday.com) ecosystem.

Formerly of
[The National Lottery Heritage Fund](https://www.heritagefund.org.uk),
[HM Land Registry](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/land-registry)
and Microtest (now [Eva Health Technologies](https://evahealth.co.uk/)).

I graduated from the [Open University](http://open.ac.uk) in 2020 with a BSc.
(Hons) in Computing and IT (Software), which I studied for alongside my
day job.

With almost ten years of industry experience, I have broad knowledge across a
number of programming languages and frameworks which I have used to build
customer-facing web applications; RESTful APIs; automated testing suites;
CI/CD pipelines; and complex integrations between existing systems. I've done
this in both the public and private sectors for mission critical projects
used by thousands of end users.

Whilst not an exhaustive list, during my career I've used C# (.NET), C++ (Qt),
JavaScript (Express, Node.JS, TypeScript), Java (Spring), PHP (Laravel),
Python (Django, Flask), and Ruby (Ruby-on-Rails).
