      <description>The weeknotes for this week are incredibly late, but as I&amp;rsquo;d half-written them, I think it&amp;rsquo;s probably worthwhile to finish them. For best results, pretend you&amp;rsquo;re reading these a week ago.
I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m already falling behind a little bit on my &amp;lsquo;start the week with a list of things to achieve&amp;rsquo; plan. I&amp;rsquo;ve been particularly busy at work to the point that I&amp;rsquo;ve barely looked at my list since writing it over the weekend.</description>

      <description>Weeknotes are harder than I anticipated. Not actually writing them, but finding the time to write them. I&amp;rsquo;m actually writing these before I&amp;rsquo;ve written the previous weeks&amp;rsquo;, which probably isn&amp;rsquo;t the approach you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to take. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try and write up a section each day next time, rather than try to do it all in one go at the end of the week.
No weeknotes next week, as I&amp;rsquo;m on annual leave ðŸŽ‰.</description>

      <description>Iâ€™m writing these later than Iâ€™d like to already (the Thursday of â€˜next weekâ€™, as opposed to the intended Friday of â€˜thisâ€™ week) and itâ€™s only the second week of this commitment, which goes some way to explain how busy Iâ€™ve been this week.
I started the week by writing a lighter version of my list of â€˜things to achieve this weekâ€™ â€“ three days this week were to be taken up with an off-site project kickoff session, which went really well.</description>

      <description>I moved into a new role semi-recently which also involved moving into a new team, which was coming to the end of the alpha phase of a project. In theory, the role shouldnâ€™t be hugely different to the one I was already fulfilling (itâ€™s an upgrade in seniority) and the differences that are there were things that I knew up front.
Software development during the alpha phase of an agile project is very different to software development during the beta phase.</description>
