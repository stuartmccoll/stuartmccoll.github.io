<p>I’m writing these later than I’d like to already (the Thursday of ‘next week’, as opposed to the intended Friday of ‘this’ week) and it’s only the second week of this commitment, which goes some way to explain how busy I’ve been this week.</p>

<p>I started the week by writing a lighter version of my list of ‘things to achieve this week’ – three days this week were to be taken up with an off-site project kickoff session, which went really well. I’m not always a fan of things like this as they’ve tended to, in my experience, veer towards ‘organised fun’-type activities, but this was organised excellently and struck a good balance between team-building and project-focussed work.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="monday">Monday</h2>

<p>Being out of the office for the majority of the week meant having to cram lots of meetings into the remaining in-office time.</p>

<p>I gave a co-presentation on unit testing in Python to the software developer community of practice in the afternoon, which I think was received well. My section of the presentation was mostly centred around the theory of unit testing as opposed to practical examples, but the whole thing inspired a lot of conversation and ‘how would I do <em>this’</em>-type questions, which is what we wanted to see from it.</p>

<p>The rest of the day was mostly spent in project-related meetings and looking over the job profile for an interview panel I’ll be sitting on.</p>

<h2 id="tuesday">Tuesday</h2>

<p>This was the first day of our off-site project kickoff. I can’t remember the last time I emptied my calendar for something that wasn’t annual leave!</p>

<p>A good mix of icebreaker activities and project talk. I’d happily have played ‘agile beer pong jeopardy’ for the rest of the week, which had around the maximum level of sporting participation that I’m willing to commit to. I like things like this because they highlight the different understandings people have of agile based on the different flavours and approaches that they’ve been exposed to.</p>

<h2 id="wednesday">Wednesday</h2>

<p>Wednesday was the second day of our project kickoff, and the first all-day session.</p>

<p>I presented a quick overview of the target architecture for the service on a whiteboard which enabled some good conversations within the team around some of our potential risks and dependencies.</p>

<p>I’m yet to decide whether it’s a good thing that I can draw the entire component diagram for the service from memory 🤔.</p>

<h2 id="thursday">Thursday</h2>

<p>Thursday was the last day of our project kickoff, which meant lots of epics and user stories to refine to enable us to hit our beta phase running. These three days were the first time I’ve felt like we’ve spent some quality time as a team looking at the problems we’re trying to solve from all angles, and it really shone through in some of the approaches and outputs from these refinement sessions.</p>

<h2 id="friday">Friday</h2>

<p>Fridays always swing one of two ways for me; either no meetings at all, in which case I can devote some solid time to project work; or booked out for one-to-ones, either my own or for those colleagues whom I line manage.</p>

<p>This Friday was no exception. I had a one-to-one with my line manager where we discussed what <em>good</em> looks like in terms of my role, as well as the kinds of things expected of a lead software engineer and how I might factor that into personal objectives.</p>

<p>I also had a one-to-one with a colleague I line manage, where we discussed their current work and objectives. I watched <a href="https://twitter.com/mseckington">Melinda Seckington</a>’s ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18MI6n9hFDI">Levelling Up Developers</a>’ talk from <a href="https://london2019.theleaddeveloper.com/">Lead Dev London 2019</a> recently, which led me onto her blog, specifically the ‘<a href="https://missgeeky.com/2018/07/11/goal-setting-workshops-managers/">Goal-setting workshops for managers</a>’ post. It made me think about the way I enable staff to set personal objectives, and whether I could improve upon that by taking some of her ideas into consideration. I don’t think I’ve even scratched the surface of being a good line manager yet, so it’s always nice to stumble across things like this.</p>

<p>I spent Saturday in Bristol visiting a friend and managed to squeeze in a visit to <a href="http://aerospacebristol.org/">Aerospace Bristol</a>, which is home to the last Concorde both to be built and to fly. It’s well worth a visit, and I’ll inevitably be dragging my wife back at some point.</p>
