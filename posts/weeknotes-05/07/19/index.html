<p>The weeknotes for this week are incredibly late, but as I&rsquo;d half-written them, I think it&rsquo;s probably worthwhile to finish them. For best results, pretend you&rsquo;re reading these a week ago.</p>

<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m already falling behind a little bit on my &lsquo;start the week with a list of things to achieve&rsquo; plan. I&rsquo;ve been particularly busy at work to the point that I&rsquo;ve barely looked at my list since writing it over the weekend. It&rsquo;s still useful to think about the things I want to work on and achieve over the course of the week, but I need to be better at going back to this list during the week and iterating upon it.Â </p>

<p>These weeknotes being as late as they are probably confirms the entire previous paragraph.</p>

<h2 id="monday">Monday</h2>

<p>This was a rare Monday where I didn&rsquo;t have an awful lot in my calendar.</p>

<p>I did spend some time talking to the designers on the team about our approach to downloads within the service and what an initial iteration might look like. There&rsquo;s so much to think about in terms of what this looks like for a user before we even talk about how the file itself looks; how we name the file and the impact this has upon low-tech users; the file format and accessibility concerns; how the download is presented within the service journey, etc. It&rsquo;s not an easy problem to solve and it really takes a skilled, multi-disciplinary team to approach it, with a user-focus in mind.</p>

<h2 id="tuesday">Tuesday</h2>

<p>Tuesday had a couple of interesting non-project meetings. I got together with the rest of the team responsible for organising an upcoming hackathon, and we&rsquo;ve started getting in touch with possible off-site venues at which to host the event. I&rsquo;m surprised by the amount of venues in Plymouth that can&rsquo;t cope with the Wi-Fi considerations we&rsquo;re asking for. Some of these are dedicated conference venues and I find it slightly depressing that in 2019 we&rsquo;re struggling to find a space that can offer stable Wi-Fi connectivity for a couple hundred people.</p>

<p>As well as the hackathon meeting, I was also part of a meeting to organise an upcoming open recruitment evening. I won&rsquo;t be about on the evening itself (annual leave ðŸŽ‰), but I think it&rsquo;s a fantastic idea and want to help in any way I can with organising.</p>

<p><img src="/img/gds-mission-patch-stickers.jpg" alt="A MacBook bearing GDS mission patch stickers" /></p>

<p>I spent a little bit of time in the evening playing about with Affinity Designer, putting together a design for a mission patch sticker for the hackathon organising team - mostly inspired by Vicky Teinaki&rsquo;s &lsquo;<a href="https://medium.com/gov-design/metaphors-we-sticker-by-4e4ecdbf8d64">Metaphors we sticker by</a>&rsquo; post.</p>

<h2 id="wednesday">Wednesday</h2>

<p>Wednesday&rsquo;s are typically my busiest day of the week for meetings. The contractors within our team are all on-site, which makes it the best day for face-to-face conversations, rather than remote meetings.</p>

<p>A couple of long meeting slots on Wednesday were taken up with working on the job profile and candidate packs for posts we&rsquo;ll be interviewing for shortly. I&rsquo;ve had a list kicking around in my head of things I&rsquo;d like to do to improve our approach to recruitment for software development posts, so these sessions were a good chance to discuss these with the panel chair and the technical lead who&rsquo;ll also be on the interview board, to determine whether said list of ideas was useful or not.</p>

<h2 id="thursday">Thursday</h2>

<p>I facilitated a retrospective for the software developer community of practice on Thursday. I&rsquo;m a core member of the community, along with a couple of colleagues, and we&rsquo;ve taken on the responsibility of organising community meetings. It&rsquo;s been hard work so far, and the community itself hasn&rsquo;t worked as I initially envisioned it would. The organisation has a long memory, and initiatives like this have been tried before and fizzled out, and people are therefore undertstandbly reluctant to involve themselves again. There&rsquo;s been a few rumblings recently that people weren&rsquo;t getting what they wanted from the community, so I thought that this retrospective session would be perfect for ironing out some assumptions and steering the community itself back on track.</p>

<p>The meeting itself was fine and there was a general sense of positivity in the room. There were plenty of suggestions for things people would like to see (more technical sessions, deliberate practice activities), but it continues to be a real struggle to get people to volunteer to lead on these activities without relying on the same people each time. I&rsquo;d love to hear some suggestions from the weeknotes crowd on how to get people to engage more.</p>

<h2 id="friday">Friday</h2>

<p>I had a really useful catch-up in the morning with the other folks from the software development specialism who&rsquo;ve volunteered to help run the open recruitment evening. We&rsquo;ve got a good mix of long- and short-term service as well as differing career backgrounds, so it was a really interesting session on how we can sell the organisation to interested candidates during the open recruitment evening.</p>

<p>Project-wise, I sat down with the service&rsquo;s solution architect and a lead software engineer in the morning to discuss an approach to reusability for part of the service journey. We don&rsquo;t always get the reusability of some of our components right, and that&rsquo;s partially down to delivery pressures, but it&rsquo;s also down to not involving the right people at the right stages of the process. It was good to have some of these discussions early on, and it&rsquo;s given us a good steer on what some of our service reusability could, and might, look like.</p>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;ve barely touched the two books I&rsquo;m reading this week, but instead I&rsquo;ve been guiltily eyeing up what might be added to my reading list next on the Waterstones website. It&rsquo;s been a month or two since I&rsquo;ve read anything but non-fiction, so I&rsquo;ll be attempting to get back into the habit of reading both fiction and non-fiction soon.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also fallen behind in the research I wanted to do towards writing my own book. I think I&rsquo;m going to need to approach this a little more seriously if it&rsquo;s ever going to go anywhere. Weeknotes crowd who&rsquo;ve written books, how do you organise your approach to both research and writing?</p>
