<p>Weeknotes are harder than I anticipated. Not actually writing them, but finding the <em>time</em> to write them. I&rsquo;m actually writing these <em>before</em> I&rsquo;ve written the previous weeks&rsquo;, which probably isn&rsquo;t the approach you&rsquo;re supposed to take. I&rsquo;m going to try and write up a section each day next time, rather than try to do it all in one go at the end of the week.</p>

<p>No weeknotes next week, as I&rsquo;m on annual leave 🎉.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="monday">Monday</h2>

<p>Great start to the week in that I actually spent a fair amount of time writing code and looking over pull requests on Monday. Now that we&rsquo;ve moved into our private beta phase I&rsquo;m expecting this to fill more and more of my time. I&rsquo;d like to reach a cadence where I&rsquo;ve already produced low-level architectural diagrams for upcoming user stories so that the rest of the team can simply work from these when we pull user stories into a sprint, but I think it&rsquo;s going to be a while before we hit this way of working.</p>

<p>Monday afternoon featured an interesting senior engineering leadership forum meeting focused around domain modelling and how we map this to business capabilities that the architecture practice have produced. I&rsquo;ve added Eric Evan&rsquo;s &lsquo;<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/">Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software</a>&rsquo; to my reading list off the back of this.</p>

<h2 id="tuesday">Tuesday</h2>

<p>I managed to spend some more solid time on project-based work on Tuesday. It feels like it&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve been able to commit reasonably-sized stretches of time to <em>just</em> project work.</p>

<p>I did spend an hour on Tuesday afternoon in a meeting for our next recruitment wave, working with colleagues on fleshing out the job profile and candidate pack for one of the posts that I&rsquo;ll be interviewing for in August.</p>

<h2 id="wednesday">Wednesday</h2>

<p>Show and tell day - lots of last minute development to finish off the user stories we took in this sprint (we&rsquo;re yet to introduce a cut-off deadline). The show and tell itself went well, but I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s things that we can improve in future presentations. Unfortunately we weren&rsquo;t able to get our cloud infrastructure running all of our components in time, which meant that we weren&rsquo;t able to <em>show</em> the service journey, short of a few screenshots.</p>

<p>Our sprint retrospective followed show and tell, and was well-run by our scrum master. It&rsquo;s probably weird to have a favourite, but this is my favourite of the agile ceremonies. I like hearing everybody&rsquo;s honest opinions on how the sprint went, and it&rsquo;s always interesting to hear the different perspectives from different specialisms.</p>

<h2 id="thursday">Thursday</h2>

<p>Emails went out today asking for participants in a software developer skills mapping workshop that I&rsquo;ve helped put together in tandem with the lead software engineers and the work stream focused on growing capability within the Digital, Data and Technology directorate. I&rsquo;m excited to see what comes out of this. If it works, it should benefit the community in terms of being able to identify training and areas for improvement, as well as benefitting our efforts around recruitment; if we can better see where our gaps in knowledge are, we can better identify the gaps we need to recruit into.</p>

<p>Project-wise we had our planning session for the next sprint, where we took in a couple of user stories and held over our infrastructure commitments from the last sprint. We also had a really interesting design-led whiteboarding session on how we approach the display of multi-title properties in our service. It&rsquo;s an interesting problem that&rsquo;s been solved in a few different ways previously, but we believe that we can improve upon these approaches. We came away with lots of questions and things to research over the next few weeks.</p>

<h2 id="friday">Friday</h2>

<p>Job profiles and candidate packs finalised for the two positions I&rsquo;ll be interviewing for in August. We&rsquo;ve had to concede on some things I&rsquo;d like to have included in an attempt to improve the process for both the organisation and potential candidates (there are more stakeholders and hard rules involved than I think I first realised), but I&rsquo;m pleased that we&rsquo;ve been able to do <em>some</em> of the things on my list.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re holding an open <a href="https://www.gradsouthwest.com/jobs/digital-data-and-technology-jobs-at-hm-land-registry-plymouth-devon/2397-1/">recruitment evening</a> which I&rsquo;ve had a very minor part in helping to organise (making up part of a team which shaped the things we want to show to potential software developers). It&rsquo;s short notice, but if you&rsquo;re interested, we have positions available. We&rsquo;ll be looking to run another one in a few weeks as part of the same recruitment wave.</p>

<p>Out of office <em>on</em>, inbox empty.</p>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;ve been slacking a bit on my weekly list of non-work tasks. I <em>did</em> manage to get some reading time in this week, and am almost finished with Shoshana Zuboff&rsquo;s &lsquo;<a href="https//www.amazon.co.uk/Age-Surveillance-Capitalism-Future-Frontier/dp/1781256845/">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power</a>&rsquo; now. I&rsquo;d definitely recommend it, but it&rsquo;s not always the easiest read. I&rsquo;ve got Tim Shipman&rsquo;s &lsquo;<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/All-Out-War-Britains-Political/dp/0008215170/">All Out War</a>&rsquo; up next. I&rsquo;m still juggling Robert C. Martin&rsquo;s &lsquo;<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/0134494164/">Clean Architecture</a>&rsquo;, which I&rsquo;m now reading in tandem with the <a href="https://www.codingblocks.net">Coding Blocks</a> podcast episodes which discuss the book (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/TheAmandaLight">Amanda Light</a> for the recommendation 👋).</p>

<p><img src="/img/lost-gardens-of-heligan.JPG" alt="The Lost Gardens of Heligan" /></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have a huge amount planned for this week. Weather permitting, my wife and I are off to the <a href="https://www.heligan.com">Lost Gardens of Heligan</a> at some point, and we might squeeze in a <a href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk">National Trust</a> visit as well. Tech-wise I saw <a href="https://blog.alexellis.io/serverless-kubernetes-on-raspberry-pi/">this</a> blogpost on building out a Kubernetes cluster on Raspberry Pis, so I&rsquo;ll be digging out the handful I own which are sat in my desk drawer and attempting to get something spun up.</p>
