There is no built-in way of doing this in the AWS Management Console, but it is possible using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI).
As an example, I&amp;rsquo;m going to create two new S3 buckets in my AWS account using Terraform, push some objects into my source bucket, and then copy the contents of this bucket into my target bucket.</description></item></channel></rss>
