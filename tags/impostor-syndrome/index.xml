      <description>I moved into a new role semi-recently which also involved moving into a new team, which was coming to the end of the alpha phase of a project. In theory, the role shouldn’t be hugely different to the one I was already fulfilling (it’s an upgrade in seniority) and the differences that are there were things that I knew up front.
Software development during the alpha phase of an agile project is very different to software development during the beta phase.</description>
