Formerly of The National Lottery Heritage Fund, HM Land Registry and Microtest (now Eva Health Technologies).
I graduated from the Open University in 2020 with a BSc. (Hons) in Computing and IT (Software), which I studied for alongside my day job.
With almost ten years of industry experience, I have broad knowledge across a number of programming languages and frameworks which I have used to build customer-facing web applications; RESTful APIs; automated testing suites; CI/CD pipelines; and complex integrations between existing systems.</description></item></channel></rss>
